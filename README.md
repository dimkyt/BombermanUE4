# BombermanUE4
Bomberman in 3D using Unreal Engine 4.18

This is my very first project using the Unreal Engine.

I have used basic geometric shapes for assets.


Controls:
	PLAYER 1
		Movement: W,A,S,D
		Bomb: E
	
	PLAYER 2
		Movement: Directional Keys
		Bomb:     Right-CTRL


I have worked on the project for about 10-15 hours, plus a few hours of tutorials to get an idea of the engine's basic mechanisms (mainly the Blueprints and how they tie together with pure C++).


TODO:
- Procedurally generated map
- Panning camera
- Maybe some text on picking up a powerUp
- Better bomb blast effect
